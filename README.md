# Financial-Document-Querying-System
A Streamlit-based web application which allows users to query information from SEC reports (10-K, 8-K, 10-Q, etc...) as well as business news articles in a Q&amp;A format. Querying is based on FDQS, which is a framework that uses context windows and prompt engineering to increase accuracy and relevance of LLM outputs.
